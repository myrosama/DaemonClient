 DaemonClient
Your Files. Your Cloud. Your Control.

DaemonClient is a secure, private, and virtually unlimited cloud storage solution that ingeniously leverages the Telegram API as a file storage backend. It provides a user-friendly interface to upload, download, and manage your files in a space that only you can access.

Features
üîê Zero-Knowledge Storage: Your files are uploaded directly to a private Telegram channel that you control. We, the developers, have zero access to or knowledge of your data.

üöÄ Blazing Fast Transfers: Utilizes concurrent chunking for both uploads and downloads to maximize speed, making it suitable for large files.

‚ôæÔ∏è Virtually Unlimited Storage: Leverage Telegram's generous file storage limits for free, without worrying about monthly fees or storage caps.

üíª Cross-Platform Access: Use the modern web interface to access your storage from any browser on desktop or mobile.

ü§ñ Fully Automated Setup: A simple, one-time setup process automatically creates and configures your personal bot and private storage channel.

How It Works
DaemonClient uses a unique architecture to guarantee your privacy and data ownership:

Automated Setup: When you first sign up, our backend service automatically creates a brand new, dedicated Telegram Bot and a private Telegram Channel just for you.

File Chunking: When you upload a file, the application splits it into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient and reliable transfers.

Secure Transfer: Each chunk is sent as a separate document to your private channel via your personal bot. All traffic is encrypted by default with HTTPS.

Private Access: The application keeps a record of the message IDs for each file chunk in a secure database. This allows it to reassemble and download your files on demand. The actual file content only ever exists in your private channel, which only you and your bot can access.

This means you get the benefits of a robust cloud storage solution without ever having to trust a third-party company with your files.
