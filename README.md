🚀 Get Started
Official Web App (Recommended)
The easiest way to use DaemonClient is through the official, hosted web application. No installation is required.

➡️ Launch DaemonClient

Self-Hosting
For advanced users who wish to run their own instance of the entire stack.

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/myrosama/DaemonClient.git

Frontend: Deploy the /public directory using Firebase Hosting.

Download Proxy: Deploy the TypeScript function in the /firebase-functions directory using the Firebase CLI.

Backend Server: The Python Flask server in /backend-server requires an "always-on" hosting provider (e.g., a paid plan on Render or PythonAnywhere) to function correctly. You must also provide your own Telegram userbot credentials in a .env file.
